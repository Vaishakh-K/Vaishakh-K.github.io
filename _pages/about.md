I am Vaishakh Keshava, a second-year masterâ€™s student from the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. I am an experienced professional with 4 years of experience designing and developing scalable software solutions. 

My area of specialization is Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Full-stack Software Development. I am passionate about building scalable and reliable intelligent systems which are end-user-ready, while not compromising on engineering and operational excellence.

My area of research is Neural Information Retrieval and NLP. I have been working with Prof. Jamie Callan on building contextualized document term representations using deep contextual language models that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a neural information retrieval system. 

This summer, I interned at Google Cloud AI, where I worked on productizing training and serving a Character-level transformer model for classification use cases within Document AI.

Before grad school, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Intuit. During my stint at Intuit, I have led critical projects end-to-end right from ideation and planning to production.

I am graduating in December 2022 and looking out for full-time opportunities in the field of ML / NLP / Search.
