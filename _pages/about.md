I am Vaishakh Keshava, a second-year masterâ€™s student from the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. My area of specialization is Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Machine Learning. I am passionate about building scalable and reliable intelligent systems which are end-user-ready, while not compromising on engineering and operational excellence.

This summer, I interned at Google Cloud AI, where I worked on productizing training and serving a Character-level transformer model for classification use cases within Document AI.

I have research experience in the domain of NLP and Information Retrieval. I have been working with Prof. Jamie Callan on sparse information retrieval systems that leverage deep contextual language models for identifying the right level of contextual information needed for efficient and effective retrieval.

Before grad school, I worked as a full-stack Software Engineer at Intuit for four years. During my stint at Intuit, I have led critical projects end-to-end right from ideation and planning to production.

I am looking out for full-time opportunities in the field of ML / NLP / Search from January 2023.
