I am Vaishakh Keshava, a first-year master's student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in building scalable and reliable intelligent systems which are end-user ready, while not compromising on engineering and operational excellence.

I graduated from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) Surathkal, India majoring in Information Technology in 2017. After which, I worked as a full-stack Software Engineer at Intuit for four years.
